# Toca Uma Pra Mim

**Toca Uma Pra Mim** is an app for musicians to **share their setlist of songs** with other people and friends. 

You can add all the songs that you can play (and might forget sometimes), and update the list along your progress. It will all be saved in your profile and, when you get in a group or a _lual_, **people can search for songs they like**
and that you know how to play them.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). The development started by students of UFCG's Computer Science.
